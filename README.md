# one-hot-encoding
this is a exercise about how to do one hot encoding in python , generally once hot encoding is converting the categorical variables in to 1 &amp; 0 , there by much easier for the computer to perform function without Bias
here i have used car data set .  where the categorial variable( car names ) have been converted into  1 & 0 using 1 hot encoding & further linear regression model is being used to predict the price of the car . since i know the target variable ( price)  which is a continious varible i used liner regression model ( supervised learning)
